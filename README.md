# Rectangles

![Rectangles](rect.jpg "Rectangles")

This is an experiment to teach myself C++ and 3D graphics programming. Rather than dive into OpenFrameworks or Ogre, I thought I would teach myself the basics of C++ from the beginning, compare/contrast with other languages I am familiar with and then add something like OF to the mix later.

I have been following the tutorials [here](http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/).
